## About This Project

This project started as a React template and has been transformed into a fully functional and stylized personal portfolio with a "hacker" theme. The main goal is to serve as an interactive cover letter for recruiters and industry professionals, showcasing not only completed projects but also frontend development skills.

The homepage features a "Matrix"-style animated background and a profile picture with a "glitch" effect to maintain a cohesive aesthetic. The projects section connects directly to the GitHub API, securely fetching and displaying my public repositories in real-time.
